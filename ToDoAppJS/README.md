This is a simple web application for managing a to-do list. 
You can add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed.

Getting Started
To use this web app, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. 

Usage
Adding a Task

The new task will be added to the list.

Editing a Task
To edit an existing task, click on the task name and then click on the edit icon (pencil). 
This will open the task input field, where you can edit the task name. 
Press the Enter key to save the changes.

Marking a Task as Completed
To mark a task as completed, click on the checkbox next to the task name. 
The task will be crossed out and its status will be changed to "completed".

Deleting a Task
To delete a task, click on the delete icon (trash can) next to the task name.

Clearing the List

This web app uses localStorage to store your to-do list data. This means that your list will be saved even if you close your browser or shut down your computer. When you reopen the app, your list will be automatically loaded from localStorage.
