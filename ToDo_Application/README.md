This is a simple ToDo List Application.
The purpose of this exercise was mostly to practice the usage of the Java Swing library.

Tasks can be added to the list both by pressing Add or Enter from the keyboard.
In order to Edit or Remove an existing Task, you have to select it first.

The runtime error "Unhandled exception type BadLocationException" was fixed by adding try and catch blocks to handle the BadLocationException exception in the getLineOfOffset(), getLineStartOffset(), and getLineEndOffset() methods when an invalid offset is specified.

More functionalities may be added in the future.
