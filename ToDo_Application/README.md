ToDo List Application
This is a simple ToDo List Application built with Java Swing. 
The main purpose of this project was to practice using the Swing library and building graphical user interfaces.

Features
Tasks can be added to the list by clicking the "Add" button or pressing the "Enter" key.
To edit or remove an existing task, you must first select it by clicking on it.
The runtime error "Unhandled exception type BadLocationException" was fixed by adding try and catch blocks to handle the BadLocationException exception in the getLineOfOffset(), getLineStartOffset(), and getLineEndOffset() methods when an invalid offset is specified.

Future Improvements
The current version of the ToDo List Application is a basic implementation with limited functionality. 
Possible future improvements could include:

Adding the ability to prioritize tasks or categorize them in some way.
Allowing users to set reminders or due dates for tasks.
Implementing a search function to quickly find specific tasks.
Adding the ability to export tasks to a file or integrate with a cloud-based storage solution for backup and synchronization across devices.
Feel free to suggest any additional features or improvements!
